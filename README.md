# nitw-character-creator


HOW TO USE TESTING VERSION:

1) Download all files by clicking on the green "Clone or Download" button here: https://github.com/syntaxidermy/nitw-character-creator
2) Click on "Download Zip" option. 
3) Save the .zip file to a folder where you will remember where it is. (Default is usually in your downloads folder) 
4) Unzip the folder. You should now have a new folder called "nitw-character-creator-master".
5) Open the folder, and find the file called "nitw.html"
6) Right click and open "nitw.html" in FIREFOX VERSION 57 (Warning: there is music!)
7) Enjoy testing the game! Please let me know if there are any issues you come accross, or any features you think could be improved. This is still a work in progress, but I value your feedback while I finish things off. I'm 'syntaxidermy' on reddit / discord.
